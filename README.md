# policy_update_orders
The target of this program is to obtain the only necessary dependent relationships of forwarding nodes to keep loop-free during the update procedure with a basic algorithm and a optimized algorithm.
As the comparison, a reference algorithm is also added in. The ref algorithm is from the thesis: "On Consistent Updates in Software Defined Networks"

With the basic and opti algorithms, the depedent relationships of nodes, the loops that may arise, the feature of loops, the feature of dependent relationships could be revealed.
With the comparison, the correctness of basic and algorithms could be proved.

NOTICE: 
1: The code is not yet well organized and annotated.
2: The basic algorithm is not totally completed, the results are incomplete.
3: Error may arise very rarely, the author is still trying to find the bug out.
.....This repository is still in improvement.....
